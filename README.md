# AB3DC's QSL Card Design Template

This is the design I used for my amateur radio QSL cards. File format is PSD and is for the 3.5" x 5.5" standard QSL card size.
These cards were made based on the GotPrint.com template as I found their service to be the cheapest.

3. Choose Orientation: Horizontal (or vertical depending on your design)
4. Choose Paper: (I used the 14pt. Gloss Coated Cover with UV Coating)

Also note that this card may not confirm to the USPS standard to be send as a postcard. But I have seen reports from other hams who used this design and had no issues sending them as postcards.
